Let me be a little kinder let me be a little blinder
To the faults of those about me let me praise a little more
Let me be when I am weary just a little bit more cheery
Think a little more of others and a little less of me
[ Mhm mhm mhm ]
Let me be a little braver when temptation bits me waver
Let me try a little harder to be all that I should be
Let me be a little meeker with the brother that is weaker
Let me think more of my neighbor and a little less of me
[ Mhm mhm mhm ]
Let me be when I am weary just a little bit more cheery
Let me serve a little better those that I am striving for
Let me be a little meeker with the brother that is weaker
Think a little more of others and a little less of me
