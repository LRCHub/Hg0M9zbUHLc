Let me be a little kinder let me be a little blinder
To the faults of those around me let me praise a little more
Let me be when I am weary just a little bit more cheery
Think a little more of others and a little less of me.

Let me be a little braver when temptation bids me waver
Let me strive a little harder to be all that I should be
Let me be a little meeker with the brother that is weaker
Let me think more of my neighbors and a little less of me.

Let me be when I am weary just a little bit more cheery
Let me serve a little harder for those I'm striving for
Let me be a little meeker with the brother that is weaker
Think a little more of others and a little less of me.

Let me be a little kinder let me be a little blinder
To the faults of those around me let me praise a little more
Let me be when I am weary just a little bit more cheery
Think a little more of others and a little less of me.

Let me be a little braver when temptation bids me waver
Let me strive a little harder to be all that I should be
Let me be a little meeker with the brother that is weaker
Let me think more of my neighbors and a little less of me.

Let me be a little kinder let me be a little blinder
To the faults of those around me let me praise a little more
Let me be when I am weary just a little bit more cheery
Think a little more of others and a little less of me...
