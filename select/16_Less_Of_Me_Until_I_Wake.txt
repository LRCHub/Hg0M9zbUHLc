As devastation comes rushing in again
Our conversations keep playing in my head
Now desperation has me hanging by a thread
I'm contemplating the end
Tomorrow you'll think less of me
You've been lying through your teeth
I know sinners never sleep
You left me jaded
A million things that I'm left thinking
Woah it's complicated
I'll give you time
That's exactly what we need
'Cause I'm done stealing
I gave you space but
Your bullshit followed me
And I'm still healing
Tomorrow you'll think less of me
You've been lying through your teeth
I know sinners never sleep
You must be wishing death on me
So carve the letters of your name
Into a bullet for my brain
How long have you been hiding your true face?
How could you just move on after
You put me in my grave?
You put me in my grave
Tomorrow you'll think less of me
You've been lying through your teeth
I know sinners never sleep
You must be wishing death on me
So carve the letters of your name
Into a bullet for my brain
