Voice yourself!
And you might understand the consequences
And everything.
You couldn't get a hold on

You have one heart
You have one soul
Think for yourself
And raise Your voice, come on!
And change the things they've done

I don't think you'll notice
What is right or wrong
The difference ain't that different
When it's written in this song
A little more of Chomsky
A little less of you and me

You better voice yourself!
And you might understand the consequences
And everything.
You couldn't get a hold on

I don't think you'll notice
What is right or wrong
The difference ain't that different
When it's written in this song
A little more of Chomsky
A little less of you and me

We cannot go on without change... no!

I don't think you'll notice
What is right or wrong
The difference ain't that different
When it's written in this song
A little more of Chomsky
A little less of you and me
