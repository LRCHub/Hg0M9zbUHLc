I won't apologize for being strong
I won't apologize for knowing what I want
Breaking free from the chains of a man's world
I speak up and they call me a bad girl
I won't apologize, my attitude
Is just a product of what you put me through
Breaking free from the glass in the ceiling
I was built to rely on my feelings

Keep on keep on moving on
Stop telling me I'm wrong
Cause you are

If you think I'm too much
Then baby good luck
I guess I'm not easy to please
If you think I'm too much
Then you're better off
With less of a woman than me
When you're with me I don't feel it's true love
The audacity to tell me I'm too much
Then go find somebody
Less of a woman
Less of a woman than me

And you can criticize the hell you want
I know you're wishing I was platinum blonde
But this body of mine is too sacred
To be changed for your own entertainment

Keep on keep on moving on
(Keep on moving on)
Stop telling me I'm wrong
Cause you are

If you think I'm too much
Then baby good luck
I guess I'm not easy to please
If you think I'm too much
Then you're better off
With less of a woman than me
When you're with me I don't feel it's true love
The audacity to tell me I'm too much
Then go find somebody
Less of a woman
Less of a woman than me

Less of a woman
Less of a woman than me
Less of a woman
Less of a woman than me

If you think I'm too much
Then baby good luck
I guess I'm not easy to please
If you think I'm too much
Then you're better off
With less of a woman than me
(Less of a woman than me)
When you're with me I don't feel it's true love
The audacity to tell me I'm too much
Then go find somebody
Less of a woman
Less of a woman than me
